<p>We’re delighted to announce <a href="https://felt.com/">Felt’s</a> continued flagship-level sustaining membership of QGIS. Felt’s contributions will allow us to continuously improve QGIS’ functionality and documentation, as well as the QGIS project infrastructure, including our 2024 Grant Programme.</p>



<p>In addition to their membership, Felt is releasing a new version of the “<a href="https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/felt/">Add To Felt</a>” QGIS plugin. Developed by the talented team at <a href="https://north-road.com/">North Road</a>, the plugin makes it easy to upload your data from QGIS to the web, where you can share it with colleagues and clients. The newest release includes raster data support and more robust preservation of styles from QGIS to Felt. This enables seamless integration and a flexible workflow between your desktop and the web.</p>
