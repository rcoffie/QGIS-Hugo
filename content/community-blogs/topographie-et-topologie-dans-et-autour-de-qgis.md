<p>Since 2018 and the arrival of LoÃ¯c Bartoletti, Oslandia has accelerated its focus on topography and topology within and around QGIS.</p>
<p>Two questions have driven this focus:</p>
<ul class="part">
<li class="">How to draw directly in GIS by integrating drawing tools inspired by the CAD world into QGIS.</li>
<li class="">How to integrate plugins for topographic calculations directly into QGIS.</li>
</ul>
<p class="part">To address this, Oslandia has worked on several fronts: training, developing open-source plugins, and improvements in QGIS.</p>
<h2 class="part">1- Plugins</h2>
<p>The following plugins were developed by Oslandia or partners, with contributions from Oslandia:</p>
<ul>
<li class="part"><strong>landsurveycodesimport</strong> : <a href="https://gitlab.com/Oslandia/qgis/landsurveycodesimport" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://gitlab.com/Oslandia/qgis/landsurveycodesimport</a><br />
A plugin for surveyors working with the point coding methodology in topography.</li>
<li class="part"><strong>QompliGIS</strong> : <a href="https://gitlab.com/Oslandia/qgis/qompligis" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://gitlab.com/Oslandia/qgis/qompligis</a><br />
A tool to ensure your dataset or plan complies with a specification.</li>
<li class="part"><strong>Total Open Station</strong> : <a href="https://github.com/totalopenstation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://github.com/totalopenstation</a><br />
An open-source project initiated by Italian and French archaeologists, it is a tool to convert various formats of survey field books.</li>
<li class="part"><strong>Topaze</strong> : <a href="https://gitlab.com/azimut-fr/qgis/topaze" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://gitlab.com/azimut-fr/qgis/topaze</a><br />
A topometric calculation tool developed with Jean-Marie Arsac (Azimut). It was a proof of concept that such calculations can be done within a GIS.</li>
</ul>
<p class="part">These plugins can be used at different stages of a project. They can be used all together or only those needed and integrated into workflows.</p>
<h2 class="part">2- Improvements on QGIS</h2>
<p>Oslandia also focuses on improving the core of QGIS. Last years, our teams have worked on:</p>
<p class="part">â€” Integration of shape tools: circles, ellipses, rectangles, regular polygons, etc.<br />
â€” Improvement of snapping tools.<br />
â€” Enhancement of Z and M coordinate support.<br />
â€” Improvement of topological tools (relationships between geometries).</p>
<p>Coming soon is the possibility to use geometry and topology validation and correction plugins directly in QGIS processing tools, developed by Jacky VolpÃ¨s and LoÃ¯c Bartoletti.</p>
<h2 class="part">3- Training</h2>
<p>Oslandia is QUALIOPI certified and offers a training program around QGIS and QField:</p>
<ul class="part">
<li class="">Drawing: Transition from CAD to GIS with QGIS: <a href="https://oslandia.com/en/formations/qgis3-dessiner-avec-qgis/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://oslandia.com/formations/qgis3-dessiner-avec-qgis/</a></li>
<li class="">Topography with QGIS (LSCI, Topaze, QompliGIS, Total Open Station)</li>
<li class="">QField Training</li>
<li class="">Deployment of QField Cloud</li>
</ul>
<p class="part"><em>Â« In 2023, 89 people were trained by Oslandia, who recommend our training at 90.9%.Â»</em></p>
<h2 class="part">4- And QField ?</h2>
<p class="part">Since our partnership with <a href="http://OPENGIS.ch" rel="noopener" target="_blank">OPENGIS.ch</a>, Oslandia offers QField Cloud server deployment services, training, and QField support.</p>
<h2 class="part">5- Coming Soon!</h2>
<p>Several technical posts are being prepared: how to open CAD files in a GIS? What are the differences between QField and LSCI? You will find them on our website in the coming weeks. <img alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Additionally, we are preparing a white paper on the topic of migrating from CAD to QGIS, which we should release in September.</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>
