<p>Hello all,</p>



<p>Some time ago, I have become a freelancer worker. For this reason, I decided to move away from wordpress.com and this kind of hobby blog and make a bit more professional website. It took some time, but it&#8217;s ready now!</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><a href="https://aneto.pt/">www.aneto.pt</a></p>



<p>I have move all the blog content to the new website. When it makes sense, I will try to update it to newer versions of QGIS and create new content regularly. Please follow me there. If you were following me using the RSS Feed, you can start using the following <a href="https://aneto.pt/index.xml">URL</a>.<br /><br />As a farewell (and welcome) gift, here&#8217;s my brand new post there:<br /><a href="https://aneto.pt/posts/tutorials/2024-05-11-create-easy-pyqgis-developement-environment-using-conda-and-vscode/">Create a PyQGIS Development Environment Using Conda and VScode</a></p>



<p>Thank for being around,</p>



<p>Alexandre Neto</p>
