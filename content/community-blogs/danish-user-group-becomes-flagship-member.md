<p><a href="https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/usergroups.html#qgis-usergroups">QGIS User Groups</a> all over the world have become an essential component of the QGIS community. They provide a point of contact for local users and developers and help people connect through localized communication channels or by organizing events. </p>



<p>Another important aspect of users groups is that many of them also have become <a href="https://qgis.org/en/site/about/sustaining_members.html">sustaining members</a> of QGIS.ORG. In total, their contributions account for a significant share of our project budget.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://qgis.dk">Danish User Group</a> now has opened a new chapter by becoming the first user group supporting QGIS on the Flagship level. And that&#8217;s a reason to celebrate <img alt="ðŸ¥³" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f973.png" style="height: 1em;" /> and to reminisce. For example, about the awesome time we had at the <a href="https://qgis2015.wordpress.com">first QGIS User Conference</a> organized at the University of Copenhagen campus in NÃ¸debo.</p>

<p>And who can forget how we all struggled to pronounce QGIS 2.16 &#8220;NÃ¸debo&#8221;?</p>

<p>And how the <a href="https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/23194">&#8220;Ã¸&#8221; upset some services</a>? Good times. </p>



<p>Thank you very much to everyone from the Danish user group and to all the other user groups, small and large, who support QGIS our project and help make it even better for everyone.  </p>
